# Handwritten Digit Recognition using Machine Learning

This repository contains a Python-based project that implements Handwritten Digit Recognition using machine learning techniques, specifically utilizing the **MNIST dataset**. The project demonstrates the process of training a model to recognize digits from 0 to 9 from images of handwritten digits.


## Introduction
Handwritten digit recognition is a fundamental task in the field of image classification and pattern recognition. This project uses the MNIST dataset, which consists of 70,000 images of handwritten digits, each 28x28 pixels in size. The goal is to classify each image as a digit from 0 to 9.

This project employs **machine learning** and **deep learning** models, such as logistic regression, support vector machines (SVM), and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to accurately predict handwritten digits.

## Model Architecture
The repository contains multiple models for performing handwritten digit recognition:
1. **Logistic Regression**: A simple machine learning model for classification tasks.
2. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: Another widely used machine learning classifier.
3. **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**: A deep learning model designed for image recognition tasks. It leverages convolutional layers to extract features and patterns from the images.

The CNN architecture includes:
- Convolutional layers to detect spatial features.
- Pooling layers to downsample the feature maps.
- Fully connected layers to perform classification.
- Softmax layer to output probability distribution for each class (0â€“9).
